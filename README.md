# Pendulum-State-Prediction-using-Neural-ODEs
This notebook demonstrates the use of Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs) to predict the state variables of a pendulum (such as angle and angular velocity). It leverages PyTorch, PyTorch Lightning, and Torchdiffeq to build, train, and evaluate models that approximate the dynamics of physical systems.
